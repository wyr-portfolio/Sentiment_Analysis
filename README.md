This system aims at analyzing if a Yelp review is positive or negative. Only the restaurants located in GTA (Great Toronto Area) will be considered. To make the analysis system more reliable, the rating stars that are higher than 4.0 stars are considered as positive, while the stars lower than 4.0 will be considered as negative.
